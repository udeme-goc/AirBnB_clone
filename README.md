## Introduction

This AirBnB Clone project is a learning exercise that involves creating a simplified version of the AirBnB website. The project includes a custom command-line interpreter for managing and interacting with different classes representing various components of the AirBnB ecosystem.

## Installation

To get started with the AirBnB Clone, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AirBnB_clone.git
   ```
2. Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd AirBnB_clone
   ```

3. Run the command interpreter:

   ```bash
   ./console.py
   ```
## Usage
Once the command interpreter is running, you can use various commands to interact with the different classes. Here are some example commands:

- `create`: Create a new instance of a class.
- `show`: Display details of a specific instance.
- `destroy`: Delete a specific instance.
- `update`: Update attributes of a specific instance.
- `all`: Display details of all instances.

## Classes
The project includes several classes that represent different components of the AirBnB ecosystem. These classes include:

- `BaseModel`: The base class for all other classes, containing common attributes and methods.
- `User`: Represents a user of the AirBnB platform.
- `State`: Represents a state within a country.
- `City`: Represents a city within a state.
- `Amenity`: Represents an amenity offered by a place.
- `Place`: Represents a place available for rent.
- `Review`: Represents a review left by a user for a place.

## Command Interpreter
The command interpreter (console.py) is a custom interface for interacting with the different classes. Use the help command to see a list of available commands and their usage.
